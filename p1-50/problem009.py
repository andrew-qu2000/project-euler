# Special Pythagorean triplet
# A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
# a^2 + b^2 = c^2
# For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2
# There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
# Find the product abc.

# Well you could just do this by multiplying the 8-15-17 triplet by 25
# But I guess we'll program something
